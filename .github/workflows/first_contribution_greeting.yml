            Take a moment to make sure the PR is in line with our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

            As a quick reminder/TL;DR:
            - PR titles and commit messages should follow the convention
            - Either if it's a fix or a feature, remember to add evidence of the changes (screenshots, videos, test runs, etc.)
            - Ask your squad teammates to review your changes
            - Don't forget to assign the PR to yourself in the assignee entry on the right
            - After the PR is approved, ask if it should be further tested by QA and deploy or create builds for them
            - Last but not least, always use `squash and merge` for PR merging against our default development branch
